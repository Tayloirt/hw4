<p>There are several volunteer opprotunities at Black Girls Code and Girls Who Code. Sign up here!
About: BGC -Black Girls CODE is devoted to showing the world that black girls can code, and do so much more.
By reaching out to the community through workshops and after school programs, Black Girls CODE introduces computer
coding lessons to young girls from underrepresented communities in programming languages such as Scratch or Ruby on Rails.
Black Girls CODE has set out to prove to the world that girls of every color have the skills to become the programmers of tomorrow.
By promoting classes and programs we hope to grow the number of women of color working in technology and give underprivileged girls a chance
to become the masters of their technological worlds. Black Girls CODE's ultimate goal is to provide African-American youth with the skills to
occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040
</p>

<p>Weâ€™re building the largest pipeline of future female engineers in the United States.We offer learning opportunities for our students
and alumni to deepen their computer science skills as well as their confidence. Our programs create clear pathways for Girls Who Code alumni
from middle and high school into the computing workforce. We build a supportive sisterhood of peers and role models who help our students and
alumni persist and succeed.</p>
